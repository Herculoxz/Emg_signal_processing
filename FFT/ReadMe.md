- Dataset is taken from here : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/481/emg+data+for+gestures

- Description of raw_data _*** file
Each file consist of 10 columns:
1) Time - time in ms;
2-9) Channel - eightEMG channels of MYO Thalmic bracelet;
10) Class  â€“thelabel of gestures: 
0 - unmarked data,
1 - hand at rest, 
2 - hand clenched in a fist, 
3 - wrist flexion,
4 â€“ wrist extension,
5 â€“ radial deviations,
6 - ulnar deviations,
7 - extended palm (the gesture was not performed by all subjects).

- 1 st plot is of the raw emg signals of the 8 channels
- 2nd plot is the FFT of the 8 channels on that data only
- 3rd plot is the PSD (power spectral density) of all the 8 channels to analyse the compression of each muscle as per the labelled class.
